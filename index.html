    <h1>The Aging Population</h1>

    <p>People in Sweden today live longer than they did before and the life length is steadily increasing for each year that goes by. This is good news!
But can the workforce take the pressure? Workforce = people who work and are in the ages between 20-63 years.
Unfortunately, the aging population comes with a problem. The workforce does not grow parallel with the growing aging population. The available workforce does not increase but will have to support more people. This is not economically sustainable.
The following graph show you what would happen to Swedenâ€™s workforce without immigration:</p>

    </div>
<!-- END GRAPH ONE -->

  <p>Over the next coming 30 years from 2015 to 2045 the workforce in Sweden will be reduced by 5% and the non working force will grow with 5% which means a shift of almost 1 million from working force to non working force. At the same time, by 2045, as the workforce in Sweden will reduce itself with 5%, the population will grow 4.3%. 
This means that a shrinking workforce have to support more people. This is not economically sustainable.</p>

      <p>Today there is a lot of people coming to Sweden due to crisis in the world.
These people are a real asset for Sweden. Since most of the immigrants coming to Sweden are in a working age they can fill the economic gap that evolves in the workforce when the Swedish population gets older.</p>
