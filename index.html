      <p>People in Sweden today live longer than they did before and the life length is steadily increasing for each year that goes by.<br> This is good news!
          But can the workforce take the pressure?</p>
          </div>
          
          <div class="col-md-5"><p>
Unfortunately, the aging population comes with a problem. The workforce does not grow parallel with the growing aging population. The available workforce does not increase but will have to support more people. This is not economically sustainable.

      <p>Over the next coming 30 years from 2015 to 2045 the workforce in Sweden will be reduced by 5% and the non working force will grow with 5% which means a shift of almost 1 million from working force to non working force. </p>
      </div>
        
        <div class="col-md-6"><p>At the same time, by 2045, as the workforce in Sweden will reduce itself with 5%, the population will grow 4.3%. 
This means that a shrinking workforce have to support more people. This is not economically sustainable.</p>

      <p>Today there is a lot of people coming to Sweden due to crisis in the world.
These people are a real asset for Sweden. Since most of the immigrants coming to Sweden are in a working age they can fill the economic gap that evolves in the workforce when the Swedish population gets older.</p>
